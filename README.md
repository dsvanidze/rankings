# University Ranking Data

This repository contains self-collected data (25/06/2022) in XLSX and CSV formats from the two sources [timeshighereducation.com](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/50/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) and [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/). The reason for collecting the data was simply to understand how the number of LinkedIn followers is distributed for the 50 most prestigious universities (source: The Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2021). Since this repository serves as the source for my LinkedIn post, more information and background on this small project is described there. Some visualisations based on the data can be found here: https://public.flourish.studio/story/1605979/
